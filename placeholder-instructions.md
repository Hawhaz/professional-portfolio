# Creating Placeholder Images for Project Redesigns

Since we couldn't automatically generate the placeholder images, follow these manual steps:

## Option 1: Use the HTML Template

1. Open the file `src/assets/projects/redesigns/placeholder.html` in your web browser
2. Take screenshots of each design card
3. Save the screenshots with the following names:
   - `slack-redesign.png`
   - `lyft-redesign.png`
   - `bbva-redesign.png`
   - `realestate-redesign.png`
4. Place these files in the `src/assets/projects/redesigns/` directory

## Option 2: Take Screenshots of the Actual Websites

For a more professional look:

1. Open each website in your browser:
   - Slack: https://slack.com/
   - Lyft: https://www.lyft.com/
   - BBVA MÃ©xico: https://www.bbva.mx/
   - Real Estate listing site (e.g., https://www.inmuebles24.com/ or similar)
2. Take screenshots of each website
3. Edit the screenshots to add a "Redesign" overlay or frame
4. Save with the same filenames as above
5. Place in the same directory

## Option 3: Use Online Tools

You can use online tools to create placeholder images:

1. Visit a site like Canva (https://www.canva.com/) or Figma (https://www.figma.com/)
2. Create 600x400 pixel designs with the following colors:
   - Slack: Gradient from #4A154B to #7C3085
   - Lyft: Gradient from #FF00BF to #7A26C1
   - BBVA: Gradient from #004481 to #1973B8
   - Real Estate: Gradient from #2E7D32 to #81C784
3. Add the text "Slack Redesign", "Lyft Redesign", etc.
4. Export as PNG files with the filenames mentioned above
5. Place in the `src/assets/projects/redesigns/` directory

## Important Note

Until you create these images, the project section may not display correctly. Make sure to create these images before viewing the updated portfolio.
